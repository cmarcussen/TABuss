We would like to thank our supervisors Bj\"{o}rn G\"{a}mback and Rune S\ae tre for guidance and support. Rune has especially been a valuable resource to have, both because of his knowledge of the BusTUC system, and his general interest in mobile application development. 
We would also like to thank our beta-testers: Jirka Konietzny, Trond B\o e Engell, Jostein Klakegg, Ola Hast, Marita Gjerde, H\aa vard Axelsen and Morten Fornes.
